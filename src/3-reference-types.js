/* 
Part A: What will team1.wins and team1.losses be after this code runs? Write your prediction as a comment below:

- Prediction: team1.wins will be 50 and team1.losses will be 15 because team2 is pointing to the same object.

Part B: Fix the code so that team2 is a TRUE COPY of team1. After making your fix, changing team2 should NOT affect team1.
Part C: Verify your fix by logging both team1.wins (should still be 45) and team2.wins (should be 50)
*/

const team2 = { ...team1 };
team2.wins = 50;
team2.losses = 15;

console.log(team1.wins);
console.log(team2.wins);
